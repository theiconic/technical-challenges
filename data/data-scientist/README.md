# Data Scientist Task

Task description and data for candidates applying to be a Data Scientist at [The Iconic](https://theiconic.com.au).

While we love seeing your work in a repository we'd prefer if you didn't fork this one. Feel free to add `@ilikedata` as a collaborator to private repositories.

## Background

Many of our customers at THE ICONIC - similar to most online shoppers - only provide the bare minimum of information needed when signing up as a new user or making a transaction on the site (i.e credit card details, delivery address etc). They do not provide their age, gender or any other personal details when they register as a new customer or they will simply purchase their items as a ‘Guest’ user.

Respecting customer privacy is of the utmost important at THE ICONIC and we understand why some shoppers are hesitant to provide personal information. However, to be able to better tailor our site, branding strategy, marketing, product and most importantly merchandising, we need to have a better handle on the profile of our shopper and understand the things that are more relevant to them.

**What we have identified here is an opportunity to ‘infer’ a customer’s gender based on the amazingly rich user behavioural data, which will allow us to better tailor our site and offerings to their needs.**

This way, the customer will be able to control their privacy and while still allowing us to tailor our offerings more suitably to our customer's needs.

There are two main ways to gauge customer behaviour:

- *Purchase Behaviour*: Identify what they purchase, how do they purchase it, frequency, what price points, what discount types resonate etc.
- *Visit Behaviour*: This includes behaviour on site, the way shoppers browse, the types of interactions respond to etc.

There are a host of such features which can be engineered, but for now, this should suffice. Using the dataset given, can you predict an "inferred" gender for our customers?

## Task

There are four stages to this task:

**Stage 1** : *SQL* - A lot of our data lives in SQL databases, data scientists need to be comfortable using SQL.

Unhash the sqlite database (`/data/sample-data/test_data.db.zip`) using the secret key provided by us, extract it.

Write SQL queries to answer the following questions:

*Note: At this stage it is ok to ignore the underlying errors in the data*

1. What was the total revenue to the nearest dollar for customers who have paid by credit card?
2. What percentage of customers who have purchased female items have paid by credit card?
3. What was the average revenue for customers who used either iOS, Android or Desktop?
4. We want to run an email campaign promoting a new mens luxury brand. Can you provide a list of customers we should send to?

**Stage 2** : *CLEAN* - Unhash the data (`/data/sample-data/test_data.zip`) using the secret key provided by us, extract it, most importantly clean it and put it in a form you can use - all programatically of course. We have also "intentionally" corrupted two columns in this file - two columns that might look correct but are not correct. They need "some correction" to be useful.

**Stage 3** : *BUILD* - Build a model that suitably answers this question and predict the inferred gender using the features provided and deriving more featueres at your end. Remember, there is no gender flag, so you are flying blind here.

**Stage 4** : *DELIVER* - Package all your process, findings and code into a reproducible document that can be understood by a business user. A repo of the code branch would be a great thing to have! This **reproducible report**\* must answer the following questions:

1. How did you clean the data and what was wrong with it? Close to 90% of a Data Scientist's job is in cleaning data
2. What are the features you used as-is and which one did you engineer using the given ones? What do they mean in the real world?
3. What does the output look like - how close is the accuracy of the prediction in light of data with labelled flags?
4. What other features and variables can you think of, that can make this process more robust? Can you make a recommendation of top 5 features you'd seek to find apart from the ones given here
5. Summarize your findings in an *executive summary*

## Evaluation

We are looking for the following:

1. You can write good quality SQL queries
2. You clean the data - we expect to see how you identified and resolved the errors
3. You make sensible decisions
4. Your model achieves high accuracy on our held out labelled gender dataset
5. Your findings, code and executive summary are packaged in an easily reproducible package - given dependencies and other instructions, we should be able to re-run your source code with the dataset in the same directory and obtain the same results and figures. Popular formats for this include RMarkdown and Jupyter Notebook (formerly IPython)

## Data

Within the `/data/sample-data/` directory we have provided 2 files:

1. For stage 1 we have included a SQLite database `test_data.db.zip`.
2. For stages 2 - 4 we have included `test_data.zip` which contains the data in newline delimited json format.

The files have been super encrypted - the password to the file is "an unserialized lowercase SHA-256 hash" of the keyword you received. Reminder the password to the file is not the keyword shared with you but the unserialized SHA-256 hash of the keyword.

The dataset comes from a simulated internal database which we use for assessing user behaviour. Users are randomly sampled and anonymised, along with programatically shifting all their behavioural metrics by set deviations.

TL;DR - Don't worry, consider this dataset to be as close to reality as possible.

The dataset is in a newline delimited JSON format, hashed and then compressed - so all the best!

**The way to open the files is through the keyword that you received from us!**
